# Account and IAM Basics

üí° **AWS Account**: Container for **identities** (users) and **resources**.

- Account **root user** has full control over all of the AWS account and any resources created within it. The root user can‚Äôt be restricted.
- IAM **User Groups** and **Roles** can also be created and given full or limited permissions. All identities start with no permissions.
- May be good practice to create multiple AWS Accounts for different uses (prod, dev, test).
- Every AWS account comes with its own running copy of IAM, which is a database.
- IAM is a globally resilient service, so any data is always secure across all AWS regions. (Exam Q)
- The IAM in each of your accounts is your own dedicated instance of IAM, separate from other accounts.


## IAM

- **User**
IDs which represent humans or apps that need access to your account
- **Group**
Collection of related users, e.g. dev team, finance or HR
- **Role**
Can be used by **AWS Services**, or for granting **external access** to your account.
Used when the number of things is uncertain.


### IAM Policy

- Allow or deny access to AWS services when and only when they‚Äôre attached to IAM users, groups or roles.


### IAM Three Main Jobs

1. **Manage identities** - An ID Provider (IDP)
Create, modify and delete IDs such as users and roles
2. **Authenticate identities**
Prove you are who you claim to be - generally username and passwords
3. **Authorize**
Allow or deny access to resources

- IAM is provided for free: No cost for users, groups and roles. Limits for number of each.
- IAM is a global service.
- Allow or deny its ids on its AWS account.
- No direct control on external accounts or users - only control local ids in your account.

**Identity federation and MFA**
Use Facebook, Twitter, Google etc. to access AWS resources.

# IAM Access Keys

- **Long-term credentials**
- Don‚Äôt update manually
- IAM User don‚Äôt need username and password - for CLI access key is enough
- IAM User can have up to two access keys
- Can be created, deleted, made inactive or made active


## Access Keys consist of two parts

- Both are provided when you create an access key
- These are only provided once - no ability to get access to the keys again. Need to be stored safely.
- Both parts are used when accessing AWS via CLI
- Access keys need to be deleted and recreated if they are leaked
- Possible to have two sets of keys such that you can create a new one, update all applications using the keys and then delete the old set

**Access Key ID:**
`ABABABABABABABA`

**Secret Access Key:**
`oierWRhoefWORIOF/DFLWAnljef`

Essential Characteristics of Cloud Computing
üí° On demand self-service: A consumer can unilaterally provision computing capabilities, such as server time and network storage, as needed automatically without requiring human interaction with each service provider. Can provision capabilities as needed without requiring human interaction.

Provision and terminate using a UI/CLI without human interaction.

Broad network access: Capabilities are available over the network and accessed through standard mechanisms that promote use by heterogeneous thin or thick client platforms (e.g., mobile phones, tablets, laptops, and workstations). Capabilities are available over the network and accessed through standard mechanisms.

Access services over any networks, on any devices, using standard protocols and methods.

Resource pooling: The provider‚Äôs computing resources are pooled to serve multiple consumers using a multi-tenant model, with different physical and virtual resources dynamically assigned and reassigned according to consumer demand. There is a sense of location independence in that the customer generally has no control or knowledge over the exact location of the provided resources but may be able to specify location at a higher level of abstraction (e.g., country, state, or datacenter). Examples of resources include storage, processing, memory, and network bandwidth. There is a sense of location independence‚Ä¶ no control or knowledge over the exact location of the resources. Resources are pooled to serve multiple consumers using a multi-tenant model.

Economies of scale, cheaper service.

Rapid elasticity: Capabilities can be elastically provisioned and released, in some cases automatically, to scale rapidly outward and inward commensurate with demand. To the consumer, the capabilities available for provisioning often appear to be unlimited and can be appropriated in any quantity at any time. Capabilities can be elastically provisioned and released to scale rapidly outward and inward with demand. To the consumers, the capabilities available for provisioning ofter appear to be unlimited.

Scale UP (OUT) and DOWN (IN) automatically in response to system load.

Measured service: Cloud systems automatically control and optimize resource use by leveraging a metering capability at some level of abstraction appropriate to the type of service (e.g., storage, processing, bandwidth, and active user accounts). Resource usage can be monitored, controlled, and reported, providing transparency for both the provider and consumer of the utilized service. Resource usage can be monitored, controlled, reported and BILLED.

Usage is measured. Pay for what you consume.

Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) Basics
EC2 is AWS‚Äôs implement of IaaS - Infrastructure as a Service Default compute service within AWS. Provide access to VMs known as instances

EC2 Key Facts & Features
IaaS - Provides Virtual Machines (Instances)
Private service by default - uses VPC networking
AZ resilient - Instance fails if AZ fails
Different instance sizes and capabilities
On-Demand Billing - Per second
Local on-host storage or Elastic Block Store (EBS)
Instance composition: CPU, memory, disk and networking. All four are billed when running. ‚ùó
Only disk storage is billed when stopped (EBS).
Instance Lifecycle
Running
Stopped
Terminated
Amazon Machine Image (AMI)
An EC2 instance can be created from an AMI, or an EC2 can be used to create an AMI
Contains
Permissions - who can and can‚Äôt use the AMI
Public - Everyone can launch instances from that AMI (Linux and Windows)
Owner - Implicit allow
Explicit - specific AWS accounts allowed
Boot Volume
The drive that boots the OS
Block Device Mapping
Links the volumes the AMI have
Mapping between volumes
Connecting to EC2
EC2 instances can run different OS‚Äôs
Windows: RDP - Remote Desktop Protocol
Protocol Port 3389
Linux: SSH protocol
Port 22
Simple Storage Service (S3) Basics
Global Storage Platform - regional based/resilient
Data is replicated across AZs in that region
Public service, unlimited data & multi-user
Movies, audio, photos, text, large data sets
Economical & accessed via UI/CLI/API/HTTP
Should be your default storing point
Objects & Buckets
Objects is the data you store
Buckets are container for objects
S3 Objects
A file made up of two parts: key and value
E.g koala.jpg : koala-image
Value is the content being stored
0 - 5 TB data
Version ID
Metadata
Access Control
Subresources
S3 Buckets
Never leaves a region unless you configure it to do so
A bucket is identified by its bucket name, which must be globally unique
Often AWS stuff is only unique within an account or region - bucket is exception to this
Unlimited Objects
Flat Structure - all objects are stored at root level in the bucket
Folders are prefixed names - but objects are still stored at the same level
Summary
Bucket names are globally unique
3-63 characters, all lower case, no underscores
Start with a lowercase letter or a number
Can‚Äôt be IP formatted e.g. 1.1.1.1
Buckets - 100 soft limit, 1000 hard per account
Unlimited objects in bucket, 0 bytes to 5TB
Key = Name, Value = Data
ARN: Amazon Resource Name
S3 Patterns and Anti-Patterns
S3 is an object store - not file or block
S3 has no file system - it is flat
You can‚Äôt mount an S3 bucket as (K:\ or /images)
Great for large scale data storage, distribution or upload
Great for ‚Äúoffload‚Äù
INPUT and/or OUTPUT to MANY AWS products
