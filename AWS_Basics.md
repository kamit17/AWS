# Account and IAM Basics

ðŸ’¡ **AWS Account**: Container for **identities** (users) and **resources**.

- Account **root user** has full control over all of the AWS account and any resources created within it. The root user canâ€™t be restricted.
- IAM **User Groups** and **Roles** can also be created and given full or limited permissions. All identities start with no permissions.
- May be good practice to create multiple AWS Accounts for different uses (prod, dev, test).
- Every AWS account comes with its own running copy of IAM, which is a database.
- IAM is a globally resilient service, so any data is always secure across all AWS regions. (Exam Q)
- The IAM in each of your accounts is your own dedicated instance of IAM, separate from other accounts.


## IAM

- **User**
IDs which represent humans or apps that need access to your account
- **Group**
Collection of related users, e.g. dev team, finance or HR
- **Role**
Can be used by **AWS Services**, or for granting **external access** to your account.
Used when the number of things is uncertain.


### IAM Policy

- Allow or deny access to AWS services when and only when theyâ€™re attached to IAM users, groups or roles.


### IAM Three Main Jobs

1. **Manage identities** - An ID Provider (IDP)
Create, modify and delete IDs such as users and roles
2. **Authenticate identities**
Prove you are who you claim to be - generally username and passwords
3. **Authorize**
Allow or deny access to resources

- IAM is provided for free: No cost for users, groups and roles. Limits for number of each.
- IAM is a global service.
- Allow or deny its ids on its AWS account.
- No direct control on external accounts or users - only control local ids in your account.

**Identity federation and MFA**
Use Facebook, Twitter, Google etc. to access AWS resources.

# IAM Access Keys

- **Long-term credentials**
- Donâ€™t update manually
- IAM User donâ€™t need username and password - for CLI access key is enough
- IAM User can have up to two access keys
- Can be created, deleted, made inactive or made active


## Access Keys consist of two parts

- Both are provided when you create an access key
- These are only provided once - no ability to get access to the keys again. Need to be stored safely.
- Both parts are used when accessing AWS via CLI
- Access keys need to be deleted and recreated if they are leaked
- Possible to have two sets of keys such that you can create a new one, update all applications using the keys and then delete the old set

**Access Key ID:**
`ABABABABABABABA`

**Secret Access Key:**
`oierWRhoefWORIOF/DFLWAnljef`
